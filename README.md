An extremely high quality touhou game launcher that completely crushes all the others.
- Full support for all official touhou games, AND support for the fan series' Len'en and Kaisendou, and various fangames to!
- Full achievement tracking! Get an overview of all your 1CCs and slowly improve as a player!
- Each achievement has a difficulty Lv! Hover your mouse on a achievement to see how hard it is!
- The "Quest Board"! Your top 6 achievements give you a Player Lv, and the quest board recommends challenges based on it!
- Super easy game modding! Toggle on any mods you like and click launch! that's it!
- Right click any game for a list of links, such as it's wiki or steam pages!
- Highly customizable with tons of settings, you can disable almost every part of it.
- Big QoL like a controller checker, automatic practice tool, and easily swap game resolution.
- Small QoL like a button to open volume mixer, a notepad to keep thoughts on, a tool to force borderless full screen mode, and more.
- You can type in the achievement box to track your NoBombNoMiss runs! ...or that your best run died in Stage 4 :(
- You don't have to use it, but it comes with a "Game Library" Folder to put all your touhou games inside. I recommend using it :3

HAVE FUUUUUN!!!!  
PS: If someone could make v-sync patches for all the latest games that would be great >_>

#### Small nerd rant:
My mod support IS the best. No other launcher has any mod support, and the only other modding tool THCrap is completely awful to mod games with. It even forces mods to apply to ALL games of your games at the same time! It's ridiculous! (and yes, some mods do actually affect more then 1 game at the same time, and in different ways). I actually feel mad that the THCrap mod support is as terrible as it is. I have never seen a community with a worse navigation of mods. How is it that they don't even have a way to tag a mod with games to tell people what game or games the mod is even for? It's completely ridiculous. I can't decide if i'm more mad AT the touhou community, or mad FOR the touhou community. X.X Well anyway my launcher should fix a lot of that, but i do hope THCrap seriously improves in the future.
